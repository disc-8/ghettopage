i mean whats there to say?
Bit modular PHP static page framework, you can edit the color and website title with a little config at top of `header.php`, add your copyright/contact/whateva at bottom with `footer.php`.
Really it just works for simple blog things, game publishing, etc, **njoy!**

## Layout
Ghettopage's layout is based on 3 panels.
* Header, with your site's title and the page's title
* Sidebar, with any external links, links to other pages, etc. 
* Main view, with literally anyffin, editable in a main page,like `index.php`

Pretty simple to grasp(like my COCK)

## Installation
literally just dump the `header`&`footer` onto your websites root, then copy&edit the example for index
its that simple. no filozofy.

**Make sure you edit the sidebar & title, its in `header.php`**
